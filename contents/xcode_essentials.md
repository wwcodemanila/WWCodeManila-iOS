# Xcode Essentials
After we had a glimpse on the language - Swift - used for building iOS Application. We will now familiarized with also one of the essentials of creating an app, the **Xcode IDE**. 

In this session, we will be able to:

* Have a tour in the Xcode IDE
* Create our own simple application

# Xcode IDE
Xcode is the IDE developed by Apple for developing software for macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS. It is only available in **macOS**.

# Creating a New Project
1. Open Xcode from the Application Directory
2. Xcode welcome window will appear. By default, the welcome screen is always displayed when Xcode is launched. If you don't want to display it on launch, toggle the checkbox ("Show this window when Xcode launches"). However, it is advisable to leave as it is.

    * **Product Name** - Xcode uses the product name you entered to name your project and the app.

    * **Team** - If this is not automatically filled in, set the team to None. For now, we can leave it as None but if you want to deploy an application to the AppStore, **Team** will be necessary.

    * **Organization Name** - The name of your organization or your own name.

    * **Organization Identifier** - Your organization identifier, if you have one. If you donâ€™t, use com.example.

    * **Bundle Identifier** - This value is automatically generated based on your product name and organization identifier.

    * **Language** - We will be using **Swift** since according to the previous session, the language is best for beginners.

6. Click Next the Create.
